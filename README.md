This YouTube Downloader is buildt with python, html, css, and javascript

this program is intended for personal use

it allows you to download youtube videos (may not work with age restricted video) and download them directly from the main page


## Installation

Step 1: install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Step 2: install packages

```bash
pip install yt_dlp
pip install flask
```

Step 3: setup IP and Port to use (you usually won't need to change this if you're running it on your own machine)

```python
ip_address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 5500
```

## Running

To run the program just go into the website and double click the `python_website.py` file or 

run `py python_website.py` in cmd in the website folder (i believe bash would also work) 

("python_website.py" is the filename i set so if you changed it then the same applies with whatever you put at the filename)
